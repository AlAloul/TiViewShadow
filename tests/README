Add tests here.
A test file is ideally a CommonJS module that returns a factory method for creating the view under test.
Something along the lines of:

exports.createView = function() {
	
	//code that creates and sets up the view
	
};


A comment is also required specifying the actual behavior and the expected behavior.
For example:

/*

actual: when applying a drop shadow the whole view appears blurry on retina displays

expected: no blur

*/

The name of the file should follow the pattern:

test-<github_issue_num>.js

For example:

test-4.js
